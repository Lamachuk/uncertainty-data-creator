# uncertainty-data-creator

Idea:
- Backend in RUST --> calculate social interaction of many entities and generate uncertainty data
    - parallel --> needs fast runtime
- Visualize real-time in browser with d3/canvas

-----

Tool to create uncertain data.
RUST or JavaScript Web Workers to simulate a zivilisation spreading information.
- Parameters for EVERY Uncertainty aspect...
--> finding different types of uncertainty?
--> e.g. certainity to go for dinner now, every step the certainity changes...
- bathroom, dinner in house, dinner out, work, sports, cinema, visit someone, ...
---> Even planning when people are in contact = information diffusion
---> Visualize DIFFERENT information diffusions at the same time
- planning something together
- infections
- money flow
- love (happyness thats spreading vs bad mood?)
